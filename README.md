# ML Engineering Learning Journey

**Goal:** Develop skills in ML Engineering for Aerospace Applications

**Timeline:** 12-18 months

**Target:** SpaceX-caliber ML Engineering roles

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or Miniconda
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ml-engineering-learning.git
cd ml-learning
```

Create the conda environment:

**Same OS (exact reproduction):**
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

**Cross-platform (Mac/Windows/Linux):**
```bash
conda env create -f environment-minimal.yml
```

Activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate ml_base
```

Verify setup:
```bash
python week1-python-fundamentals/test.py
```

## Current Phase
Phase 1: Python & Math Foundations (Week 1/12)
