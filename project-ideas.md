# This is a markdown file to hold overall ideas as I work through the ml-learning curriculum

## Ideas
- Rebuild heat transfer finite difference program in python instead of Matlab
- Build an AI trained on specific aero concepts that can solve complex aeronautical engineering problems.
- Build an investment calculator. Look up historical inflation and apply it to the calculation.
